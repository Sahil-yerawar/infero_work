/*
Whenever there is a problem that asks you to minimize or maximize a value where
ordering is not necessary (where the first value can be more than the second one
 provided a later value is greater than or equal to the first for example), use
 binary search to fix the upper bound and then try finding a solution in a
 greedy manner.
